      In finance, stock (also capital stock) consists of the shares of which
      ownership of a corporation or company is divided.(Especially in American
      English, the word "stocks" is also used to refer to shares.) A single
      share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in
      proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the
      shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings,
      proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims
      such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these
      up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not
      all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued
      for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a
      certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or
      after other classes of shareholders.
